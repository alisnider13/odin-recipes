        <li>1 1/2 tsp dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tbsp parsely, basil, 1 tsp salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occassionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tbsp parsely, and 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
